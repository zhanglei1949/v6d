   :description: Vineyard (v6d), a CNCF sandbox project, is an in-memory immutable data manager
      that provides **out-of-the-box high-level** abstraction and **zero-copy in-memory** sharing for
      distributed data in big data tasks, such as graph analytics (e.g., `GraphScope`_), numerical
      computing (e.g., `Mars`_), and machine learning.
